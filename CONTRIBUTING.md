# Contributing to Variabot

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Variabot! It's people like you that make Variabot such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/new)! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork Variabot](https://github.com/your-repo/fork) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #38 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b 38-add-awesome-new-feature
```

## Get the test suite running

Make sure you're running the test suite locally before you start making changes.

```bash
python test_basic.py
```

## Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

## Make a Pull Request

At this point, you should switch back to your master branch and make sure it's up to date with Variabot's master branch:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:your-repo/variabot.git
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

Then update your feature branch from your local copy of master, and push it!

```bash
git checkout 38-add-awesome-new-feature
git rebase master
git push --force-with-lease origin 38-add-awesome-new-feature
```

Finally, go to GitHub and [make a Pull Request](https://github.com/your-repo/compare) :D

## Pull Request Checklist
Each PR description MUST include:
- Purpose (1â€“2 lines).
- Scope (what changed vs explicitly out-of-scope).
- Traceability list: vault sections touched or relied upon.
- Adaptability + mutation summary.
- Live-runs summary (manual, automated, environment).
- Rollback plan (how to fallback and initiate an alternate route forward to achieve goals).
- MUTATE LIVING CODE TO NEXT GOAL-ACHIEVING ADAPTATION STRATEGY if any element is missing then Copilot should supply a stub and mark gaps.

## Keeping your Pull Request updated

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
