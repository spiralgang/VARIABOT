# Linux Kali Android Standards

**Disclaimer:** This documentation is intended for authorized security research and device recovery only. Do not attempt privilege escalation or security bypass techniques on devices without explicit permission from the owner and compliance with all applicable laws.
## Environment Detection
- Function: `is_privileged()`—Check su/Magisk; if half-root, trigger escalation.
- Kali Chroot Setup: Via Termux: `pkg install proot-distro; proot-distro install kali; ./start-kali.sh`.
- Privilege Escalation: If full root access is required, refer to official Kali NetHunter or Magisk documentation for supported methods. Ensure all actions comply with device owner permissions and local laws. Avoid using security bypass techniques unless explicitly authorized for research or recovery purposes.

## Bot Adaptation
- Living Bots: Python daemon in Kali chroot; monitor logs, mutate script vars (e.g., retry payloads) via GitHub API push.

## Privilege Obtaining
- Nonstop Search: Scan for 'hacker' entries (e.g., adb shell exploits); plan necessity for owner-righteous root.
